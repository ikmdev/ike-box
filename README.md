# IKE in a Box

This is all of the infrastructure needed for running the entire Integrated 
Knowledge Environment. 

This will include the following:

* sonatype nexus - a repository manager for maven artifacts
* posgresql database - a database for nexus
* ike website - a static website that is built from the ikmdev repo at 
* [ikmdev/ikmdev-site](https://github.com/ikmdev/ikmdev-site)
* komet - a web application for managing knowledge artifacts, which can be found at 
[ikmdev/komet](https://github.com/ikmdev/komet)

## Disclaimer

This repository is for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for production use. Please consult 
security professionals before using these products in a production environment.  In general, it is suggested
that you use hardened images or equivalent organizational systems for production use.  This repository is not 
intended to contain hardened images.

## Prerequisites

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  (or something compatible, such as on your local machine.

## Running Locally

Follow the steps below to build and run static website on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine

2. Change local directory to cloned repo location

3. Enter the following command to execute startup all of the applications:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d 
  ```

4. To view the applications directly open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost


5. To shut down the applications, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

The application should now be running in the Docker container using Nginx as Reverse Proxy with the path based routing can be access as:

[localhost/nexus](http://localhost/nexus) and [localhost/komet](http://localhost/komet) in your web browser.

## Application access credentials
komet - a web application requires login credentials which is defined in users.ini file located at ./komet-data/users.ini

Note: On the off chance that you have issues with running on the specific port on your computer, the
docker-compose file is configurable to allow for other ports.  This can be run in the following way, substituting 8080
for whatever port you would like to assign:

```bash
NGINX_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d
```

## Running on a Server

This is the complete steps that worked on Amazon linux by deploying a subdomain-based routing solution using Nginx, Docker Compose, and Terraform code on AWS to procure and set up a domain name and all of itâ€™s necessary records for hosting IKE in a Box

## Prerequisites - running on server
 1. DNS setup: Script for DNS setup in AWS or EasyDNS
Here is the branch link for EasyDNS https://github.com/jlgrock/ike-box/tree/domain-script
2. DNS setup with AWS: Domain Registration and DNS Setup with Terraform
3. Install Docker and Docker Compose ( detail steps provided below)
4. AWS EC2-instnace
5. Install Terraform and Git on EC2-instance

 ### Domain Registration and DNS Setup with Terraform
   This will register your domain (e.g., ikedesigns.com) and create subdomain records (e.g., nexus.ikedesigns.com, komet.ikedesigns.com, www.ikedesigns.com) pointing to your EC2 instance.

 ```bash
 cd dns-management/domain-registration
```
Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out <name>
```
Review and Apply the Terraform Plan

```bash
terraform apply
```
Confirm the action when prompted.

Verify DNS Records:

After Terraform completes, verify your records in the AWS Route 53 console.
It may take a few minutes for DNS propagation.

### Connect to the Instance:
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
example: ssh -i ~/.ssh/docker-deployment-key.pem ec2-user@18.119.11.183
```
### Update system

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```
 
### Install Docker
```bash
sudo dnf install docker -y
```
### Start Docker
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
  
```
### Enable Docker to start on boot
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
### Add your user to the docker group (log out/in after this)
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
 
### Install Docker Compose (latest version)
```bash
DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
 
```
 
### Make Docker Compose executable
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  
```
### Verify installations
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## Deploy Application Services

Clone ike-in-box repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikmdev/ike-box.git

```
## Run Docker Compose with Subdomain Profile
Use Docker Compose profiles to switch between subdomain and path-based routing.


Note: 
* Only one Nginx service should be active at a time to avoid port conflicts.
* Only the nginx-subdomain service is activated when you use the --profile subdomain flag
* You may want to remove the container_name: nginx line or make the names unique if you ever run both at once.
* No conflicting port mappings. (Only one Nginx service should run at a time on the same port.)


### Build and Start Services:
```bash
docker-compose --profile subdomain --build
docker-compose --profile subdomain up -d
```
To shut down the applications for Subdomain Profile, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose --profile subdomain down
  ```
Check Running Containers:
```bash
docker ps
 
```
Check Nginx Logs (if troubleshooting):
```bash
docker logs nginx-subdomain
 
```

### Access application with your Sub-domains

Open your browser and visit:

http://www.ikedesigns.com

http://nexus.ikedesigns.com

http://komet.ikedesigns.com
